# **Data Scenario #1: E-Commerce Product Recommendation - RAG Systems**

Welcome to the first Data Scenario! In this project, we tackle a real-world challenge: building a personalized product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **OpenAI models**.

---

## **Scenario Overview**

You have been hired by **ShopVista**, a leading e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products from electronics to home goods. The company aims to improve its recommendation system by developing a **context-driven search feature** that provides personalized suggestions based on users' search phrases.

**Your task:**  
As an AI Engineer, use **RAG systems** and **OpenAI's models** to create a recommendation system that delivers highly relevant product suggestions. Your solution should enhance the shopping experience by making recommendations intuitive and tailored to users' needs.
