# **Data Scenario #7: High-Dimensional Data Analysis with Clustering & Visualization**

Welcome to another Data Scenario! In this project, weâ€™ll work with **high-dimensional datasets** and apply clustering techniques with visualizations to uncover patterns hidden in complex data. ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“Š

---

## **Scenario Overview**

Youâ€™ve joined a data science team at a tech company thatâ€™s trying to segment customers based on their behavioral data. Each customer is represented with dozens of variables, making it hard to understand patterns directly.

**Your task:**  
Use dimensionality reduction, clustering, and advanced visualizations to group similar customers and present your findings in an interpretable way.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Introduction to the Scenario**
- Get familiar with the challenge: understanding structure in high-dimensional data using unsupervised learning and visualization tools.

### **2. Task 1 - Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Import a structured dataset (e.g. CSV) with many columns.  
- Perform an initial data check to understand distributions, correlations, and completeness.

### **3. Task 2 - Normalize the Data**
- Apply feature scaling to standardize the data and prepare it for clustering.

### **4. Task 3 - Apply K-Means Clustering**
- Use K-means to group data points into clusters.  
- Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow plot.

### **5. Task 4 - Visualize Clusters in 2D**
- Use scatter plots and color-coded points to show clustering outcomes.  
- Use pair plots to explore relationships between dimensions.

### **6. Task 5 - Parallel Coordinate Plot**
- Create a PCP to visualize multi-dimensional cluster structure.

### **7. Task 6 - Dimensionality Reduction**
- Apply PCA or t-SNE to reduce dimensions.  
- Project data to 2D while maintaining cluster separation.
