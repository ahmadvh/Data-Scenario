## **Scenario Overview**

Youâ€™ve just joined **BuzzLab**, a fast-growing marketing agency preparing for a major product launch. Your boss wants answers â€” backed by data â€” on how to create viral content across TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

**Your task:**  
Analyze a dataset of 5,000 viral social media posts to uncover:
- Which platforms drive the most engagement  
- What hashtags trend by region and content type  
- How likes, shares, and comments differ across formats  
- One surprising insight that could give BuzzLab a strategic edge  

You'll work with a rich dataset containing post-level metrics and use Python to generate insights that drive smart marketing decisions.
