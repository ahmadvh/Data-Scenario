# **Data Scenario #2: Contextual Search with Text Embeddings**

Welcome to the second Data Scenario! In this project, we explore how AI can be applied to solve a real-world problem: identifying relevant news headlines about **climate change and global warming** from a historical dataset using **text embedding vectors** and **similarity measures**.

---

## **Scenario Overview**

You have been hired by **MX News**, a 40-year-old news company known for its trusted journalism. The company wants to identify 10 of the most relevant headlines related to **climate change and global warming** from their March 2004 archive.

**Your task:**  
As an AI Engineer, use a **local text embedding model** to ensure privacy and perform a **contextual search**. Extract the embedding vectors for each headline and compare them with a search phrase embedding to find the most relevant matches.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Introduction to the Scenario**
- Understand the goal: identifying climate-related headlines using AI techniques while preserving privacy by working with local resources.

### **2. Task 1 - Set Up the Project Environment**
- Install necessary libraries and tools.  
- Configure a local Llama embedding model for text processing.

### **3. Task 2 - Preprocess the Dataset**
- Load and clean the dataset of news headlines.  
- Prepare the data for embedding vector generation.

### **4. Task 3 - Generate Embedding Vectors**
- Extract embedding vectors for each headline using the Llama model.  
- Generate an embedding vector for the search phrase: *"climate change and global warming."*

### **5. Task 4 - Compute Similarity Scores**
- Use cosine similarity to compare the search phrase vector with each headline's vector.  
- Rank the headlines based on similarity scores.

### **6. Task 5 - Extract the Top 10 Headlines**
- Select the 10 most relevant headlines based on the similarity rankings.  
- Verify and refine the results for accuracy.
