# **Data Scenario #10: Customer Support Automation with LangChain & Ollama**

Welcome to another Data Scenario! In this project, youâ€™ll step into the role of a data scientist at a fast-scaling e-commerce startup, helping automate customer service using local language models. ðŸ¤–ðŸ“©

---

## **Scenario Overview**

Youâ€™ve just joined **Trendora**, a booming e-commerce platform. The support team is overwhelmed by repetitive emails, complaints, and review analysis. To improve operations without compromising data privacy, your boss wants everything running locally using open-source LLMs.

**Your task:**  
Use **LangChain** and **Ollama** to build a local AI system that can:
- Rephrase angry customer emails into calm and respectful responses  
- Translate informal messages into professional English  
- Extract structured data (like delivery speed or price feedback) from raw product reviews  
- Enforce reliable JSON formatting for easy downstream processing  

Youâ€™ll use Python to prototype and test these use cases step by step â€” all with locally deployed language models using Ollama.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Introduction to the Scenario**
- Understand Trendoraâ€™s challenge: local AI to support customer service at scale.

### **2. Task 1 - Set Up Ollama Locally**
- Install Ollama and download the Meta LLaMA 3.2 model to run language models on your machine.

### **3. Task 2 - Test a Simple Prompt**
- Send a basic math prompt to validate that the model is running correctly.

### **4. Task 3 - Rephrase an Angry Email**
- Rewrite a frustrated customer message in a professional tone using LangChain prompts.

### **5. Task 4 - Build Reusable Prompt Templates**
- Use `PromptTemplate` to standardize how messages are rewritten.

### **6. Task 5 - Extract Structured Info from Reviews**
- Extract gift status, delivery time, and price perception from a product review using prompt engineering.

### **7. Task 6 - Use Output Parsers for JSON Consistency**
- Apply LangChainâ€™s `StructuredOutputParser` to enforce a consistent JSON schema.

### **8. Task 7 - Parse and Use Model Output**
- Convert the modelâ€™s output into a Python dictionary for use in automation workflows.
