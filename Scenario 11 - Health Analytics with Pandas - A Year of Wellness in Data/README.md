# **Data Scenario #11: Wellness Tracking with Pandas**

Welcome to another Data Scenario! In this project, youâ€™ll step into the role of a data scientist helping a friend analyze a full year of personal wellness data to uncover patterns in activity, sleep, hydration, and mood. ðŸ§ ðŸ“ˆ

---

## **Scenario Overview**

Your friend has been meticulously tracking their wellness stats every day for the past year â€” steps, sleep hours, mood, water intake, and more.

**Your task:**  
Use **Pandas** and **Seaborn** to explore and visualize this dataset to answer questions like:
- Do they walk more on days they feel energetic?  
- Does better sleep reduce tired days?  
- How consistent is their water intake?

You'll use Python and Jupyter Notebook to clean the data, create visualizations, and extract insights step by step.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Understand the Dataset**
- Load the CSV file and explore its structure: columns, types, and missing values.

### **2. Preprocess the Data**
- Convert dates, check data types, and sort entries to ensure time-based accuracy.

### **3. Visualize Daily Steps Over Time**
- Create line plots and weekly aggregations to understand movement trends.

### **4. Analyze Mood vs. Activity**
- Use box plots to compare how step counts vary by mood.

### **5. Explore Sleep Patterns**
- Create violin plots to see how sleep hours change across emotional states.

### **6. Calculate Correlations**
- Build a heatmap to show how sleep, hydration, and activity metrics are connected.
