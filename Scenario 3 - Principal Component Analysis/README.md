# **Data Scenario #3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Customer Insights**

Welcome to another Data Scenario! In this project, weâ€™ll use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify complex customer data and uncover valuable patterns for business decisions. ðŸ§ ðŸ“‰

---

## **Scenario Overview**

Youâ€™re a data scientist at a retail company, analyzing a dataset filled with customer detailsâ€”**age, income, purchase frequency**, and more. With so many features, it becomes hard to spot clear trends.

**Your task:**  
Use PCA to reduce the number of features while keeping the most relevant information. This helps identify the core behavior patterns that matter for marketing, customer service, and sales planning.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Introduction to the Scenario**
- Understand the challenge of high-dimensional data and how PCA helps simplify analysis without losing key insights.

### **2. Task 1 - Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Load a dataset containing various customer attributes.  
- Visualize and assess the correlation between features.

### **3. Task 2 - Standardize the Data**
- Prepare the data by applying feature scaling, a critical step before using PCA.

### **4. Task 3 - Apply PCA**
- Use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions while retaining the highest variance.  
- Plot the explained variance to understand how many components to keep.

### **5. Task 4 - Interpret Results**
- Analyze the reduced components to uncover trends in customer behavior.  
- Discuss how these insights can inform business strategy.
